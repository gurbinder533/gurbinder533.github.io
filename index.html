              Intel Optane DC Persistent Memory is a new kind of byte-addressable memory with higher density and 
              lower cost than DRAM. This enables affordable systems that support up to 6TB of memory. In this paper, 
              we use such a system for massive graphs analytics. We discuss how such a system should be deployed for such 
              applications, and evaluate three existing shared-memory graph frameworks, Galois, GAP, and GraphIt, on large 
              real-world web-crawls. We recommend algorithms and runtime optimizations for getting the best performance on 
              such systems using the results of our study. We also show that for these applications, the Galois framework 
              on Optane DC PMM is on average 2x faster than D-Galois, the state-of-the-art distributed graph framework, 
              on a production cluster with similar compute power. Thus, Optane DC PMM yields benefits in productivity, 
              performance, and cost for massive graph analytics.

                Distributed-memory clusters are used for in-memory processing of
                very large graphs with billions of nodes and edges. This requires
                partitioning the graph among the machines in the cluster. When a
                graph is partitioned, a node in the graph may be replicated on several
                machines, and communication is required to keep these replicas
                synchronized. Good partitioning policies attempt to reduce this
                synchronization overhead while keeping computational load balanced
                across machines. A number of recent studies have looked at
                ways to control replication of nodes, but these studies are not conclusive
                because they were performed on small clusters with eight
                to sixteen machines, did not consider work-efficient data-driven algorithms,
                or did not optimize communication for the partitioning
                strategies they studied.
                This paper presents an experimental study of partitioning strategies
                for work-efficient graph analytics applications on large KNL
                and Skylake clusters with up to 256 machines using the Gluon communication
                runtime which implements partitioning-specific communication
                optimizations. Evaluation results show that although
                simple partitioning strategies like Edge-Cuts perform well on a
                small number of machines, an alternative partitioning strategy called
                Cartesian Vertex-Cut (CVC) performs better at scale even though
                paradoxically it has a higher replication factor and performs more
                communication than Edge-Cut partitioning does. Results from communication
                micro-benchmarks resolve this paradox by showing that
                communication overhead depends not only on communication volume
                but also on the communication pattern among the partitions.
                These experiments suggest that high-performance graph analytics
                systems should support multiple partitioning strategies, like Gluon
                does, as no single graph partitioning strategy is best for all cluster
                sizes. For such systems, a decision tree for selecting a good partitioning
                strategy based on characteristics of the computation and the
                cluster is presented.

                Graph analytics systems must analyze graphs with billions of vertices and edges which require several terabytes of storage. 
                Distributed-memory clusters are often used for analyzing such large graphs since the main memory of a single machine is usually 
                restricted to a few hundreds of gigabytes. This requires partitioning the graph among the machines in the cluster. Existing 
                graph analytics systems usually come with a built-in partitioner that incorporates a particular partitioning policy, but the 
                best partitioning policy is dependent on the algorithm, input graph,and platform. Therefore, built-in partitioners are not 
                sufficiently flexible. Stand-alone graph partitioners are available, but they too implement only a small number of partitioning 
                policies.This paper presents CuSP, a fast streaming edge partitioning framework which permits users to specify the desired 
                partitioning policy at a high level of abstraction and generates high-quality graph partitions fast. For example, it can 
                partition wdc12, the largest publicly available web-crawl graph, with 4 billion vertices and 129 billion edges, in under 2 
                minutes for clusters with 128 machines. Our experiments show that it can produce quality partitions 6× faster on average 
                than the state-of-the-art stand-alone partitioner in the literature while supporting a wider range of partitioning policies.

                This paper presents Phoenix, a communication and synchronization
                substrate that implements a novel protocol for
                recovering from fail-stop faults when executing graph analytics
                applications on distributed-memory machines. The standard
                recovery technique in this space is checkpointing, which
                rolls back the state of the entire computation to a state that
                existed before the fault occurred. The insight behind Phoenix
                is that this is not necessary since it is sufficient to continue
                the computation from a state that will ultimately produce the
                correct result. We show that for graph analytics applications,
                the necessary state adjustment can be specified easily by the
                application programmer using a thin API supported by the
                Phoenix system.
                Phoenix has no observable overhead during fault-free execution,
                and it is resilient to any number of faults while guaranteeing
                that the correct answer will be produced at the end
                of the computation. This is in contrast to other systems in this
                space which may either have overheads even during fault-free
                execution or produce only approximate answers when faults
                occur during execution.
                We incorporated Phoenix into D-Galois, the state-of-the-art
                distributed graph analytics system, and evaluated it on two
                production clusters. Our evaluation shows that in the absence
                of faults, Phoenix is  24 faster than GraphX, which provides
                fault-tolerance using the Spark system. Phoenix also
                outperforms a checkpoint-restart technique implemented in
                D-Galois: in fault-free execution, Phoenix has no observable
                overhead, whereas the checkpoint-restart technique has 31%
                overhead. In addition, Phoenix mostly outperforms checkpointing
                when faults occur, particularly in the common case
                when only a small number of hosts fail simultaneously.

                We present an O(n)-round distributed-memory algorithm
                called Min-Rounds BC (MRBC) for computing the betweenness
                centrality (BC) of every vertex in a directed
                unweighted graph with n vertices. This algorithm can
                also be used to solve the all-pairs-shortest-paths (APSP)
                problem in such graphs. Our algorithm is framed in the
                CONGEST model, and it improves the number of rounds
                by at least a constant factor over previous results for
                directed APSP and BC.
                We implemented MRBC in D-Galois, the state-of-theart

                by 3.3× on the average for the graphs in our test suite.
                As a result, MRBC is 2.6× faster on the average than
                Brandes BC for real-world web-crawls on 256 hosts.

                The trend towards processor heterogeneity and distributed-memory
                has significantly increased the complexity of parallel programming. In addition,
                the mix of applications that need to run on parallel platforms today is very diverse,
                and includes graph applications that typically have irregular memory accesses and
                unpredictable control-flow. To simplify the programming of graph applications
                on such platforms, we have implemented a compiler called Abelian that translates
                shared-memory descriptions of graph algorithms written in the Galois programming
                model into efficient code for distributed-memory platforms with heterogeneous
                processors. The compiler manages inter-device synchronization and
                communication while leveraging state-of-the-art compilers for generating device specific code. The experimental results show that the novel communication optimizations
                in the Abelian compiler reduce the volume of communication by 23×,
                enabling the code produced by Abelian to match the performance of handwritten
                distributed CPU and GPU programs that use the same runtime. The programs
                produced by Abelian for distributed CPUs are roughly 2.4× faster than those
                in the Gemini system, a third-party distributed CPU-only system, demonstrating
                that Abelian can manage heterogeneity and distributed-memory successfully
                while generating high-performance code.

                This paper introduces a new approach to building distributed-memory graph analytics systems that exploits heterogeneity in processor types (CPU and GPU), partitioning policies, and programming models. The key to this approach is Gluon, a communication-optimizing substrate.

                Programmers write applications in a shared-memory programming system of their choice and interface these applications with Gluon using a lightweight API. Gluon enables these programs to run on heterogeneous clusters and optimizes communication in a novel way by exploiting structural and temporal invariants of graph partitioning policies.

                To demonstrate Gluon’s ability to support different programming models, we interfaced Gluon with the Galois and Ligra shared-memory graph analytics systems to produce distributed-memory versions of these systems named D-Galois and D-Ligra, respectively. To demonstrate Gluon’s ability to support heterogeneous processors, we interfaced Gluon with IrGL, a state-of-the-art single-GPU system for graph analytics, to produce D-IrGL, the first multi-GPU distributed-memory graph analytics system.

                Our experiments were done on CPU clusters with up to 256 hosts and roughly 70,000 threads and on multi-GPU clusters with up to 64 GPUs. The communication optimizations in Gluon improve end-to-end application execution time by ∼2.6× on the average. D-Galois and D-IrGL scale well and are faster than Gemini, the state-of-the-art distributed CPU graph analytics system, by factors of ∼3.9× and ∼4.9×, respectively, on the average.

                Distributed-memory multi-core clusters enable in-memory processing of very large graphs with billions of nodes and edges. Recent distributed graph analytics systems have been built on top of MPI. However, communication in graph applications is very irregular, and each host exchanges different amounts of non-contiguous data with other hosts. MPI does not support such a communication pattern well, and it has limited ability to integrate communication with serialization, deserialization, and graph computation tasks. In this paper, we describe a lightweight communication runtime called LCI that supports a large number of threads on each host and avoids the semantic mismatches between the requirements of graph computations and the communication library in MPI. The implementation of LCI is informed by lessons learnt from two baseline MPI-based implementations. We have successfully integrated LCI with two state-of-the-art graph analytics systems - Gemini and Abelian. LCI improves the latency up to 3.5× for microbenchmarks compared to MPI solutions and improves the end-to-end performance of distributed graph algorithms by up to 2×.

                Numerical weather prediction (NWP) models use mathematical models of the atmosphere to predict the weather. Ongoing efforts in the weather and climate community continuously try to improve the fidelity of weather models by employing higher order numerical methods suitable for solving model equations at high resolutions. In realistic weather forecasting scenario, simulating and tracking multiple regions of interest (nests) at fine resolutions is important in understanding the interplay between multiple weather phenomena and for comprehensive predictions. These multiple regions of interest in a simulation can be significantly different in resolution and other modeling parameters. Currently, the weather simulations involving these nested regions process them one after the other in a sequential fashion. There exists a lot of prior work in performance evaluation and optimization of weather models, however most of this work is either limited to simulations involving a single domain or multiple nests with same resolution and model parameters such as model physics options. In this paper, we evaluate and enhance the performance of popular WRF model on IBM Blue Gene/Q system. We consider nested simulations with multiple child domains and study how parameters such as physics options and simulation time steps for child domains affect the computational requirements. We also analyze how such configurations can benefit from parallel execution of the children domains rather than processing them sequentially. We demonstrate that it is important to allocate processors to nested child domains in proportion to the work load associated with them when executing them in parallel. This ensures that the time spent in the different nested simulations is nearly equal, and the nested domains reach the synchronization step with the parent simulation together. Our experimental evaluation using a simple heuristic for allocation of nodes shows that the performance of WRF simulations can be improved by up to 14% by parallel execution of sibling domains with different configuration of domain sizes, temporal resolutions and physics options.

                Normalized Cross Correlation (NCC) is an efficient and robust way for finding the location of a template in given image. However NCC is computationally expensive. Fast normalized cross correlation (FNCC) makes use of pre-computed sum-tables to improve the computational efficiency of NCC. In this paper we propose a strategy for parallel implementation of FNCC algorithm using NVIDIA's Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) for real-time template matching. We also present an approach to make proposed method adaptable to variable size templates which is an important challenge to tackle. Efficient parallelization strategies, adopted for pre-computing sum-tables and extracting data parallelism by dividing the image into series of blocks, substantially reduce required computational time. We show that by optimal utilization of different memories available on multicore architecture and exploiting the asynchronous nature of CUDA kernel calls we can obtain speedup of the order 17X as compared to the sequential implementation.
